# Pre-Processing for Non-AI Multi-Targets Tracking from Gaussian Blur to Dilate & Erode
## Project of XACC2021 workshop - Yuhao Liu & David Mallas√©n Quintana 
Just read two images(like two frames), then go through the image diff, gaussian blur, canny edge detection, dilate, and erode, to get some little spots. Then another program perhaps can use their result to find the moving targets.
